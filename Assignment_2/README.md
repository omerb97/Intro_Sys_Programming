Assignment 2:
In this assignment we learned and used Python.
In the first two parts we had to extract olympics information about the competitions from and input file.
We then had to use that information to determine winners, scores, and rankings.
In the second part we used SWIG to incorperate C files into Python. 
We used these files to create the aformentioned "Olympics" class that we used in part one. 
All of the instructions can be found in the instructions PDF.
